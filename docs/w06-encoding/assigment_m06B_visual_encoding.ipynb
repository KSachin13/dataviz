        "# Homework 6B - Visual Encoding\n",
        "In this assignment, you will explore how to encode different data features to visual properties using the movies dataset located in `Datasets/movies.json`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will start with simpler visualizations and then move to more complex (and potentially cluttered) visualizations. Finally, you will create a focused visualization that uses only a few selected encodings.\n",

        "## Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment is divided into three parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Project Setup**:  \n",
        "\n",
        "   - Set up your Python and Jupyter (or VSCode) environment.  \n",
        "\n",
        "   - Clone or download the repository provided in class (refer to the class notes).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Simple Visualizations:** Create basic visualizations using one or two encodings.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cluttered Visualization:** Create a visualization that encodes many features simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Focused Visualization:** Create one or more visualizations using a few chosen encodings, and discuss your design choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Documentation**:  \n",
        "\n",
        "   - Comment your code and add markdown explanations for each part of your analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Submission**:  \n",
        "\n",
        "   - Save your notebook and export as either PDF or HTML. If the visualization is not shown in the html, submit a separated version with altair html. Refer to: https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/starting.html#publishing-your-visualization (you can use the `chart.save('chart_file.html')` method).\n",
        "   - Submit to Canvas.\n",

        "\n",
